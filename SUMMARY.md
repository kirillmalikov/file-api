# Summary

## Comments

// A short comment about the assignment in general

- Spring requires paid version of Intellij IDEA - not cool. Wouldn't pure Kotlin or Java assignment be enough?
- Gradle seems to be more convenient to use than Maven nowadays
- In general assignment is good. Not very complicated, but also not boring. The volume of work seems to be
  just fine. It was interesting and fun.

// Was the Acceptance Criteria easy to understand?

- > "When an invalid request is made, 400 Bad Request is returned with message containing information about the error"
  >
  What is considered as invalid? Can we return 404 if token is invalid? Should we validate anything? - not clear

## Which part of the assignment took the most time and why?

Testing, writing tests, bug-fixing. Why? It's kinda always like this. Writing code is simple, making it work as intended -
not so simple :)

## What You learned

// Example: Learned the basics about Kotlin

Refreshed some things in my memory.

## TODOs

// TODO: Write what features should/could be added to this API
// Example: Add file type validation to file upload endpoint

- File type/size validation
- Same files handling
- Other implementations of FileStorage: GridFS, S3 etc
- Improved security and authentication: eg JWT, hashes etc
